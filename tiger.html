                        <h3>TIGER</h3>
                       <p>
                        The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and
                         a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark 
                         vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates, such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous 
                        areas of habitat to support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring.
